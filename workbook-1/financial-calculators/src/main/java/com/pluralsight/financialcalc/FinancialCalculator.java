/*Calculator 1: A mortgage calculator - it is used to calculate out how much a monthly payment for a loan would be (minus any insurance or taxes), as well as how much interest you would pay over the life of the loan.
Â»
It would accept the principal, interest rate, and loan length from the user
It would display the expected monthly payment and total interest paid
Example: A $53,000 loan at 7.625% interest for 15 years would have a $495.09/mo payment with a total interest of $36,115.99
This calculator would use a compounded interest formula.
